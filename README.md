# Neural Transition-based Dependency Parsing

## Project description
The notebook contains the implementation of a neural parser for transition-based dependency parsing.
There two proposed implementations:
- Bi-LSTM to extract features from configurations and MLP to classify;
- pre-trained BERT for embedding the configuration words and MLP to choose the most probable transition.
